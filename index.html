                Once there was a tree... and she loved a little boy. And everyday the boy
                would come and he would gather her leaves and make them into crowns and play
                king of the forest. He would climb up her trunk and swing from her branches 
                and eat apples. And they would play hide-and-go-seek. And when he was tired, he would sleep in her shade.
                And the boy loved the tree... very much. And the tree whas happy. But time went by.
                And the boy grew older. And the tree was often alone. Then one day the boy came to the tree and 
                the tree said, 
            </span>

        <span class="two">
            Ven, nino, subete a mi trono y mecete en mis ramas y come mis
            manzanas y juega bajo mi sombra y se feliz.

    </div>
    <span id="twoo">
        Come, Boy, come and climb up my trunk and swing from my branches and eat apples and play in my shade and be happy.
    </span>

    <div>
        <span id="three">
            "I am too big to climb and play" said the boy.
            "I want to buy things and have fun. I want some money. 
            Can you give me some money?"
        </span>
    </div>
            
    <div>
        <span id="four">
            "Lo siento" dijo el arbol, pero yo no tengo dinero.
            Solo tengo hojas y manzanas. Coge mis manzanas 
            y vendelas en la cuidad. Asi tendras dinero y seras feliz.
        </span>
    </div>

    <div>
        <span id="fourr">
            "Im sorry," said the tree, "but I have no money.
            I have only leaves and apples. Take my apples, Boy and sell them
            in the city. Then you will have moeny and you will be happy."

            And so the boy climbed up the tree and gathered her apples and carried
            them away. And the tree was happy. But the boy stayed away for a long time... and the 
            tree was sad. and the one day the boy came back and the tree shook with joy and she said,
